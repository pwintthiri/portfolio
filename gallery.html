                <p>This outfit was made for the R4MODA fashion showcase as part of Residential College 4's Arts Night. This was inspired by the 
                    butterfly top I'd seen online. Since the theme for Arts Night was Y2K, I added rhinestones and distressed the denim when creating 
                    the top to give it the shiny effect that some Y2K outfits have. The skirt was repurposed from thrifted jeans, and has the pleated 
                    look of Y2K denim skirts. This was topped off with rhinestones to match the top. It was my first time distressing denim with a seamripper, 
                    and as painful as it was, it was worth it for this outfit.

                <p>This outfit was made for the R4MODA fashion showcase as part of Residential College 4's Arts Night. The theme here is "Runway" and this dress was 
                    inspired by some of the simple runway dresses of the early 2000s. Initially, I wanted to make the dress ankle-length but after trying it out, it felt 
                    too bulky and I decided to make it shorter and add the two panels on the side for a more flowy look. I then added the gold belt to tie the dress together. 
                    This dress took the longest amongst all my outfits for the showcase because I did not like my initial idea. Even though I was hesitant to take apart the dress I 
                    had already made to change the skirt part of this dress, I'm glad I did because now I'm happy with how it looks.

                <p>This outfit was made for the R4MODA fashion showcase as part of Residential College 4's Arts Night. My theme for this outfit was "Denim". The 
                    first item I made was the bucket hat. Since this outfit would be denim on denim, I wanted the accessories to be denim too. I also had denim from my butterfly 
                    outfit, so I decided to make the hat patchwork to not give the outfit some extra texture and colour. As for the jeans, I came across this video of patchwork 
                    jeans online and immediately thought of recreating it for this outfit to match the hat. One issue I faced was that I accidentally got the wrong size jeans when 
                    thrifting because of the US and UK sizing and had to make it smaller. Overall, I'm really proud of how this outfit looks and I realised making patchwork items is also a 
                    good way to use up scraps and reduce fabric waste when sewing.

                <p>I saw this floral tulle fabric on sale at Spotlight and HAD TO get it. I didn't know what to do with it 
                    at the time but it was too pretty not to get. This dress is inspired by the Selkie dress. Instead of the typical
                    bandeau bodice, I wanted a different shape and settled for a sweetheart bodice. I also modified where
                    the bodice ended and added a waistband. The skirt part is made up of two layers of circle skirts and one
                    gathered tulle layer. Overall, this is probably one of my favourite pieces I've made. The best part? It's glittery.

                <p>I wanted to make a simple white flowy top that could be both dressed up and down and used this V-neck 
                    pattern from a sale at Spotlight (again) since I really liked the V-neck and the sleeves. The pattern was 
                    modified to include buttons. I really wanted to use the iridescent, rose-shaped buttons but they were 
                    too small for button holes. Hence, I used press studs and sewed the buttons on top. Also one of my personal 
                    favourites hehe.

                <p>I'd wanted to make a flowy tiered dress for the longest time and I had this green floral fabric
                    that I bought 4 yards of. Even after making a top, I still had a lot of the fabric. Naturally, this 
                    fabric was used for the dress. As much as I enjoy gathered dresses, 3 yards is certainly
                    A LOT of fabric to gather. It was a very fun process, however, and I really like how the dress flows when
                    turing or walking.

                <p>This top is closely (maybe a bit too much) inspired by the puff sleeve cropped blouse from Uniqlo, with the sleeve modified. 
                    I made a mockup for this that was less cropped but it did not look right, so I eventually kept the cropped look. This was my 
                    first time using the shirring thread, which took a while to figure out, but was really fun to work with. This is probably the 
                    simplest top I've made and it was really fun.</p>

                <p>I made this hat for as a component of my denim piece for the runway. One side of the hat is a patchwork, ripped denim look, and the other
                    is a sparkly denim fabric. I realised halfway that the video I was following required interfacing, which I did not have, 
                    so I sewed on an additional layer of denim fabric on the brim of the hat. I was quite unsure of how it would turn out, 
                    given that I'd never made anything patchwork in the past, but I'm quite happy with how it turned out.

                <p>The first pair of trousers I've ever made! I was always scared of making pants because I was worried
                    they wouldn't fit. Despite being very vibrant, the purple was calling to me when fabric shopping. I made this with the 
                    guidance of my prof (bless her soul for understanding the confusing instructions on the pattern paper).
                    After the workshops, we realised the waistband was attached upside down so it was redone. This is one of the 
                    hardest projects I've done because I couldn't understand a lot of the instructions on the pattern paper. 
                    BUT it's removed my fear of making trousers! I also wanted to make a matching top ever since I bought the 
                    fabric. It is inspired by a top I saw in a mall, which was too short for my comfort. This top is longer, 
                    and I added shirred panels to the back because I'd just learnt to use the shirring thread and was very excited about it.
